# Cyling-Project
A personal Java project to track my cycling too and from university.

The application uses a graph with green vectors indicating progress and red vectors to indicate decline. There is also a gray line to show the average speed. 

Currently the application uses .txt files to save the inputted data, however I am currenlty updating this to use MySQL.
